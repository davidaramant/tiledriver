This assembly holds metadata used to generate the UWMF data model and parser.

Due to the way T4 templates work, it is extremely cumbersome for classes they consume to live in the same assembly they do.  T4 templates operate on a built DLL, which means that the DLL must exist on disk with the classes/methods it is expecting.  If it doesn't, it will fail to generate output, which will additionally cause compilation errors!

Also, Tiledriver doesn't need the metadata information at runtime, so there is no reason to include it in the output.
