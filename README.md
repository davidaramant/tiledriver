## TODO

### Technical Debt

- [ ] The GUI project is broken under .NET 5
- [ ] The parsing system is old and ugly; Sector Director has a much nicer one
  - [ ] Get rid of T4 templates
  - [ ] UWMF
  - [ ] XLAT
  - [ ] MapInfo
- [ ] There is way too much "temporary" code hanging out in `ECWolfLaucher`
- [ ] There is a `SteamGameSearcher` class that deals with the Windows Registry. Where is this supposed to live? Can you make a truly cross-platform console app in .NET 5?

### Level Generation

- [ ] Move any and all cellular automata stuff out of the launcher project
- [X] Create generator for Wang tiles
- [ ] Create generator for lighting variants
